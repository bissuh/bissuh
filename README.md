# Product & Development & Clowning

Born and raised in the Amazon, Manaus city, I am half computer scientist, half actor, half creator and another half bad in mathmatics.

## Ingresse

I co-founded [@ingresse](https://www.ingresse.com/) in 2012. It changed the way tickting services were provided in Brazil. As the tech founder, I helped a team that did a lot with few resources, creations such as:

* __Backstage__: the first all-in solution for events. From entrance control to sales reports.
* __Ticketing as a Service__: we are the first company, and only one, to provide software solutions to other ticketing companies that wants to have a high level tech but have no money or time to create their own.
* __Ticketing transfer__: we allowed our customers to send their tickets to their friends within the platform. It is an example of such a small feature that changed the way other tickting companies started to deal with the social aspect of events.

## BrazilJS Manaus

BrazilJS Manaus was an event that allowed me to give back to Manaus part of so much things that I got by being raised there. I deployed the event with friends and we could give local developers the sense of being part of a worldwide commmunity. The mini-tiny-short-documentary above can give you a piece of understand about what happened there.
